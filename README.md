# OpenFDA.NET

OpenFDA.NET is a .NET class library and azure web service for accessing the [OpenFDA](https://open.fda.gov) data source. 

I will focus on looking at drug interaction reports for now. 

I am using: 
  * [NEST](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-net/tree/master/src/Nest#nest-)
  * [Newtonsoft.JSON](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json)

and managing these packages via the incomparably handy [NuGET](https://nuget.org)
